This was the first 100% functional website that I've ever created so I know I made a lot
of mistakes and some things shouldn't have done that way but I think this site at least 
is decent, and have a decent design. Now I know more how to use bootstrap a bit better
for the next time, I need to learn JS and we divided the work in a decent way, it could
have been divided better but there is no problem. My coworkers here really made a good
job, so this project was easier than I expected to be done. That's all I have to say.
