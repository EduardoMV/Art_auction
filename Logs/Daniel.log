Personally, I would say that my performance in the development of the project was enough, it was fair, what I had to do in the project was equivalent to what the others had to do. That is why I consider that the work I did with my team was average, not excellent, but good.
Like my colleagues, his performance was very good, I would say excellent, there are no complaints, we all worked just and necessary, in addition, communication was quite good within the team.
