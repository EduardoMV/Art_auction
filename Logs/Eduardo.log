As for the project, I believe it was a pretty complex one;
We just had three days since we had the announcement of the same.
At first we encountered challenges regarding git, merging branches and
pulling repositories. In one ocassion, my colleague Omar made a force push
on the git so we had to make a new repository. I find the experience positive 
since we learned to use git to the perfection.

Regarding the webpage, I found the most challenging part on the grid system;
distribution of things and the usage of bootstrap for view resizing was pretty 
difficult, but I'm glad I had colleagues that taught me how to use them correctly.

As for the Html and CSS desing i did not encounter many challenges, instead, I 
learned new things, for example, the usage of background images, the implementation
of animated buttons, (In my opinion the thing im proudest) how to make a beautiful nav bar.

In conclusion, this was a hard and challenging project but I had fellow classmates who helped
me on this challenging journey, i learned a lot, and im looking forward programming to the next
level.
